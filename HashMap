Question-)What is Hashmap?
Answer-)HashMap is used to store values as key-name pair
Key points to remember for interviews:
1)Stores key-value pairs.
2)Unique keys (no duplicate keys allowed).
3)Values can be duplicated.
4)Unordered (does not maintain insertion order).
5)Not synchronized (use ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety).
6)Uses hashing internally for fast access.
